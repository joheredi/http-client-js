/**
 * Minimal health-check test to validate the Spector mock server lifecycle.
 *
 * This test verifies that:
 * 1. The globalSetup successfully starts the Spector mock server on port 3002
 * 2. The server responds with HTTP 204 on the health-check endpoint
 * 3. The server serves the expected routes
 *
 * This test should be replaced or supplemented by real e2e tests in SPECTOR-3+.
