## Vitest picking up submodule tests

**Problem:** Running `pnpm test` without restricting test includes caused vitest to discover
and run thousands of tests from `submodules/`, leading to failures unrelated to this project.

**Fix:** Added `test.include: ["test/**/*.test.ts", "test/**/*.test.tsx"]` to `vitest.config.ts`
to scope test discovery to only the project's `test/` directory.
